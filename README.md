VillagePrototype
================

Three.js-powered RTS camera with simple buildings &amp; landscape. I will be implementing functionalities over unregular periods of time, but will try to follow through the list.

To do:
---
- [x] Canvas initialization
- [x] Flat terrain
- [x] Moving camera
- [ ] Simple terrain & textured buildings
- [ ] Mouse click-object intersection

How to run:
--
No server needed, downloading & extracting the zip from [here](https://github.com/sasoh/VillagePrototype/archive/master.zip) + opening __main.html__ in a WebGL-supporting browser ([Can I use WebGL](http://caniuse.com/webgl)) would be sufficient.

Got sample models from 3D artist friends. Should be looking at file loading now. And maybe rearrange the buildings. Setting better near/far planes & toying with the fog might be an interesting point to focus at at some point.

Added autoscroll & zoom capability.
